# MSPP STATA Recitation for Quant 1

[McCourt School of Public Polic, Georgetown University](http://mccourt.georgetown.edu/)

Recitation is designed to give you the opportunity to learn and use the statistical software package, Stata. This class is designed to supplement the work you do in Statistical Methods for Policy Analysis and ultimately prepare you for the client-based or thesis capstone.

### Attendance

Attendance is kept through an online sign-in sheet each week. Please sign-in before you leave and check that you have attended. A sample sign-in sheet can be found [here](http://goo.gl/forms/X7PpGvpdrw). Please make sure you are able to access the sign-in sheet before the first recitation. Each professor uses attendance information differently, so I cannot tell you the consequences of missing a class (besides the fact that we will miss you!). Due to availability of space, it is important that you attend the recitation section that you are assigned. If circumstances prevent you from attending your section, please email your correponding TA first before attending a different section.
    
### Obtaining Stata

You can download the software from http://georgetown.onthehub.com/ and obtain a license online. You can also go to the UIS Service Desk in St. Mary’s Hall with your laptop to obtain a copy of Stata 13 for your personal computer.

### Additional Help

While I hope that you learn a lot this class, much of your proficiency in Stata will come from trial-and-error as you tackle problems sets and use the software in your workplace or internship. The following resources can be particularly helpful:
